== This is forked version with some changes

## Setup

* Development is on Windows (Yes, I am one of those guys)
* Deploy on Ubuntu

## Changes

* Add os checking (some modules don't work on Windows. current strategy is to comment out those codes)
* Provide two kinds of symbolic link. One from Linux family `ln -s` and other is Windows `mklink`. Start script will handle symbolic link creation (into `ob` and `sinergis`)
* Lots of updates in API v.2
* Use forever instead of nohup in deployment

== If you get simaya source code from simaya repository, do this just after cloning:
**NOTE**. This doesn't apply here. no submodule is defined.
git submodule init
git submodule update
